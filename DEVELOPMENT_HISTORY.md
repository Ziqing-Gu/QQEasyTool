## 1.05 Candidate — 2026-09-22 / Gain, Norm Target and EQ responsiveness

中文：移植 QQDeBreath 1.25 已验收的交互性能优化。Gain、Norm Target 直接缩放波形缓存；全局和区域 EQ 的波形计算使用可取消后台线程，只采用最新结果。缓存区域峰值和绘制范围，动态频谱只处理当前窗口涉及的区域，连续拖动不再触发全文件静态频谱计算。ARA 区域参数更新限频，试听更新与波形计算分离。保留 EasyTool 的 Voice/Breath/Noise/Others 分轨、旧 Sibilance 类型兼容、重叠区域行为、Auto Apply 关闭时的预览/Apply 以及 1.04 播放同步规则。

English: Ported the accepted QQDeBreath 1.25 responsiveness improvements. Gain/Norm Target scale cached display data; global/selected EQ waveforms run in a cancellable latest-request worker. Cached peaks and painting intervals avoid repeated source scans, dynamic spectra visit only the current window, and continuous dragging avoids whole-file static spectra. Selected ARA parameter updates are throttled independently of waveform calculation. EasyTool Voice/Breath/Noise/Others routing, legacy Sibilance compatibility, neutral overlap behavior, manual preview/Apply and 1.04 transport semantics are preserved.

Scope: editor/display only; processor, EQ DSP, analysis and parameter format unchanged. No new audio smoothing algorithm. EQ waveform display may update after dragging. No new macOS build or DAW acceptance is claimed. Candidate awaiting user acceptance; Stable remains 1.04.

Validation: Windows x64 VST3 build and Steinberg load check passed. 30 reference cases at 44.1/48/96 kHz, each with six Gain/Target settings plus global/selected EQ, agree with 1.04 within 2.06028e-7 relative display rounding. Scalar changes submit zero full renders. Latest EQ, source replacement/clear and worker close passed. Existing routing/state/ARA input and transport probes passed. Synthetic 120-second/500-region test: 1000 scalar updates 236.457 ms; 500 EQ submissions 182.869 ms; paint 14.0675 ms. These are internal UI entry-point measurements, not host end-to-end latency.


## 2026-09-20 — 1.04 Stable

Ported ordinary VST3 transport synchronization from the user-approved QQDeBreath 1.23 Stable baseline. Stopped waveform selection survives Play startup; later DAW relocation restores the original timeline. ARA playback/input and region processing remain unchanged. Transport tests at 44.1/48/96 kHz, existing route/state/ARA-input probes and Steinberg loading checks passed. The user designated this version Stable and requested Plan B, C and D. The approved Windows binary remains unchanged.

Previous development entries remain in CHANGELOG.md and SIBILANCE_DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md.
